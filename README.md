# WordPress - IP location redirect

## description
this plugin is intended for wordpress multisite installation to choose countries and redirect to another domain of your sites, depending on a users IP address. if you e.g. have a shop, where there are different payment options for used sites.

## setup
install and go to IP Redirects in the admin panel to setup. choose either automatic or redirect chosen by user. a footer message with the different sites is possible. if the plugin is activated for both options (automatic and user chosen redirect) a modal window is shown with information, given in the the plugins admin panel and a list of all given sites with their domains. a user is able to switch to the site which was called in first place by a link shown in the modal window.

## testing
- tested with Wordpress 6.4.5
- tested with one redirect if is country and another redirect if is NOT country

## TODOs
- add more IP APIs options
